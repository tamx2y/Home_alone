### 1. Background
In recent years, inflation has significantly affected consumer behavior across many demographic groups. Among them, independent single youths—typically defined as young adults living alone and managing their own finances—represent a particularly vulnerable population due to relatively low and often unstable income, high housing costs, and limited wealth accumulation.

### 2. Objective
This study aims to examine how inflation affects the consumption expenditure patterns of independent single youths in South Korea, particularly focusing on changes across different consumption categories. By identifying which items are most affected and which are more resilient to price changes, we can better understand the lived economic experiences of this group.

### 3. Data 
The analysis is based on data from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey and the Consumer Price Index provided by KOSTAT.
